# How to find sold listings:
# 1. Go to ebay.com
# 2. Search for your item (e.g., "Dell Latitude 5420")
# 3. On the left sidebar, check "Sold Items" under "Show only"
# 4. Copy the URLs of sold listings
# 5. Add them to this file (one per line)
#
# Note: URLs should be to individual item pages (/itm/...), not search results
